# Solution

## Overview

This solution provides a detailed comparison between two versions of a server application written in Rust. The **Old Implementation** represents a basic single-threaded echo server, while the **New Implementation** introduces enhancements such as multithreading, improved error handling, and more robust message handling. The goal of the new implementation is to allow the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, improve scalability, and support additional message types.

## Key Differences

### 1. **Message Handling**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The server only handles one type of message: `EchoMessage`.
  - When the server receives a message, it echoes it back to the client.

- **New Implementation**:
  - The server can handle multiple types of messages:
    - **AddRequest**: The server processes two numbers, computes their sum, and sends back an `AddResponse`.
    - **EchoMessage**: The server echoes back the received message to the client.
  - This improves flexibility, enabling the server to process different kinds of client requests.

### 2. **Multithreading**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The server is **single-threaded** and processes one client at a time.
  - This results in a blocking behavior where the server cannot handle multiple clients simultaneously.

- **New Implementation**:
  - The server is **multithreaded**, using `thread::spawn` to handle each client connection in its own thread.
  - This allows the server to handle multiple client connections concurrently, improving performance and scalability.

### 3. **Error Handling**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - Error handling is done in specific parts of the code, mainly during message decoding and writing to the stream.
  
- **New Implementation**:
  - Enhanced error handling throughout the code:
    - **Client disconnection**: The server properly shuts down the connection using `stream.shutdown(Shutdown::Both)` when a client disconnects.
    - **`WouldBlock` errors**: The server handles non-blocking read errors gracefully, avoiding unnecessary CPU usage.
    - Detailed error messages are logged for failed read operations, connection issues, and message decoding failures.

### 4. **Server and Client Interaction**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The server only echoes messages received from the client.
  
- **New Implementation**:
  - The server supports multiple types of client interactions:
    - **AddRequest**: When an `AddRequest` is received, the server calculates the sum and sends an `AddResponse`.
    - **EchoMessage**: When an `EchoMessage` is received, the server echoes the message back to the client.
  - This allows for more complex communication between the server and clients.

### 5. **Non-blocking Server and Accept Loop**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The server uses a **blocking accept loop** with `listener.accept()`, meaning it processes one connection at a time.

- **New Implementation**:
  - The server runs in **non-blocking mode** (`listener.set_nonblocking(true)`), which allows the server to accept new connections without blocking.
  - When no connections are available, the server gracefully sleeps for a short period (`thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100))`) to reduce CPU usage.

### 6. **Shutdown Logic**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The server has a `stop()` method that sets the `is_running` flag to `false`, halting the server.

- **New Implementation**:
  - The `stop()` method is enhanced to properly shut down client connections when the server is stopped.
  - The server sends a shutdown signal and logs the event when the server is stopped.

### 7. **Logging**

- **Old Implementation**:
  - The logging is basic, focusing on client disconnections and error messages.

- **New Implementation**:
  - **Detailed logging**:
    - Logs each new client connection.
    - Logs each received message type and the server’s response.
    - Logs error messages for issues such as failed message decoding, connection problems, and read errors.
    - Tracks server shutdown events for better monitoring and debugging.

## Summary of Changes in the New File

1. **Message Handling**: 
   - The server now supports multiple message types (`AddRequest`, `EchoMessage`), improving flexibility.

2. **Multithreading**: 
   - The server is multithreaded and can handle multiple clients concurrently by spawning a new thread for each client.

3. **Error Handling**: 
   - The new implementation has robust error handling, including proper shutdown procedures and handling of non-blocking read errors.

4. **Client Interaction**: 
   - The server processes more complex interactions, such as computing sums for `AddRequest` and echoing messages for `EchoMessage`.

5. **Non-blocking I/O**: 
   - The server uses non-blocking I/O to efficiently manage client connections without blocking the main thread.

6. **Shutdown Mechanism**: 
   - The server properly shuts down client connections and logs shutdown events.

## Conclusion

The new implementation builds on the old server by adding multithreading, better message handling, and improved error handling, making it a more robust and scalable solution. These improvements enable the server to handle multiple clients concurrently, process more complex requests, and operate more efficiently in a production environment.
